How does Tox protect my privacy?
Tox protects your privacy by:

Removing the need to rely on central authorities to provide messenger services
Enforcing end-to-end encryption with perfect forward secrecy as the default and only mode of operation for all messages
Making your identity impossible to forge without the possesion of your personal private key, which never leaves your computer
How do I add someone to my contacts list?
Look in the profile or settings panel of your client to get your Tox ID which should look something like:

56A1ADE4B65B86BCD51CC73E2CD4E542179F47959FE3E0E21B4B0ACDADE51855D34D34D37CB5
Give yours to your friend and get your friend to add it. That's it.

What happens when I remove someone from my contacts list?
If you remove someone from your contacts list, they will see you go offline, as if you closed your client normally. They can't communicate with you any longer until you add them to your contacts list again.

Does Tox leak my IP address?
Tox makes no attempt to cloak your IP address when communicating with friends, as the whole point of a peer-to-peer network is to connect you directly to your friends. A workaround does exist in the form of tunneling your Tox connections through Tor. However, a non-friend user cannot easily discover your IP address using only a Tox ID; you reveal your IP address to someone only when you add them to your contacts list.
